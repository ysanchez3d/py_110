# Convert a String to a Signed Number
# In the previous exercise, you developed a function that converts simple numeric strings to integers. In this exercise, you're going to extend that function to work with signed numbers.

# Write a function that takes a string of digits and returns the appropriate number as an integer. The string may have a leading + or - sign; if the first character is a +, your function should return a positive number; if it is a -, your function should return a negative number. If there is no sign, return a positive number.

# You may assume the string will always contain a valid number.

# You may not use any of the standard conversion functions available in Python, such as int. You may, however, use the string_to_integer function from the previous exercise.

from string_to_number import string_to_integer

def string_to_signed_integer(s):
    match s[0]:
        case '-':
            return -string_to_integer(s[1:])
        case "+":
            return string_to_integer(s[1:])
        case _:
            return string_to_integer(s)

# Examples
print(string_to_signed_integer("4321") == 4321)  # True
print(string_to_signed_integer("-570") == -570)  # True
print(string_to_signed_integer("+100") == 100)   # True
