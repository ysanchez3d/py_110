# Odd Lists
# Write a function that returns a list that contains every other element of a list that is passed in as an argument. The values in the returned list should be those values that are in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on elements of the argument list.

# Examples

def oddities(list):
    return list[::2]

print(oddities([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == [2, 4, 6])  # True
print(oddities([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 3])        # True
print(oddities(["abc", "def"]) == ['abc'])     # True
print(oddities([123]) == [123])                # True
print(oddities([]) == [])                      # True
# Bonus question: Try to solve the problem using list slicing.
